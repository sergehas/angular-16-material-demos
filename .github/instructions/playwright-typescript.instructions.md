## Test Writing Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Locators**: Prioritize user-facing, role-based locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, etc.) for resilience and accessibility. Use `test.step()` to group interactions and improve test readability and reporting.
- **Assertions**: Use auto-retrying web-first assertions. These assertions start with the `await` keyword (e.g., `await expect(locator).toHaveText()`). Avoid `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` unless specifically testing for visibility changes.
- **Timeouts**: Rely on Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms. Avoid hard-coded waits or increased default timeouts.
- **Clarity**: Use descriptive test and step titles that clearly state the intent. Add comments only to explain complex logic or non-obvious interactions.

### Test Structure

- **Imports**: Start with `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';`.
- **Organization**: Group related tests for a feature under a `test.describe()` block.
- **Hooks**: Use `beforeEach` for setup actions common to all tests in a `describe` block (e.g., navigating to a page).
- **Titles**: Follow a clear naming convention, such as `Feature - Specific action or scenario`.

### File Organization

- **Location**: Store all E2E test files in the `e2e/` directory.
- **Naming**: Use the convention `<feature-or-page>.spec.ts` (e.g., `login.spec.ts`, `search.spec.ts`).
- **Scope**: Aim for one test file per major application feature or page.

### Assertion Best Practices

- **UI Structure**: Use `toMatchAriaSnapshot` to verify the accessibility tree structure of a component. This provides a comprehensive and accessible snapshot.
- **Element Counts**: Use `toHaveCount` to assert the number of elements found by a locator.
- **Text Content**: Use `toHaveText` for exact text matches and `toContainText` for partial matches.
- **Navigation**: Use `toHaveURL` to verify the page URL after an action.

## Example Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Demo - Icon Feature", () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("http://localhost:4200/demo/icons");
  });

  test("should display icon list", async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step("Verify icon grid is visible", async () => {
      await expect(page.getByRole("main")).toContainText("Icons");
    });

    await test.step("Verify aria structure", async () => {
      await expect(page.getByRole("main")).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
        - main:
          - heading "Icons" [level=1]
      `);
    });
  });
});
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing tests, ensure:

- [ ] All locators are accessible and specific and avoid strict mode violations
- [ ] Tests are grouped logically and follow a clear structure
- [ ] Assertions are meaningful and reflect user expectations
- [ ] Tests follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Code is properly formatted and commented
